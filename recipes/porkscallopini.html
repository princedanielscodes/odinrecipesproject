    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pork scallopini is a classic Italian dish: pork chops are pounded very thin and are simmered in a creamy wine
        sauce full of briny capers, bright lemon, and lots of butter.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (4-ounce) boneless lean pork loin chops (about 1/2-inch thick)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped shallot</li>
        <li>1 large garlic clove, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>/3 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 small lemon, thinly sliced and seeded</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons drained non-pareil capers</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>Place pork chops between 2 sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap. Pound with a meat mallet to 1/4-inch
            thickness. Sprinkle pork evenly with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place flour in a shallow dish; dredge seasoned cutlets in flour, and shake off excess. Heat 1 tablespoon
            each of the butter and the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high until butter foam subsides. Add
            2 pork cutlets, and cook until golden on bottom, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer cutlets to a large plate;
            wipe out skillet. Repeat cooking process with 1 tablespoon of the butter, remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and
            remaining 2 cutlets. Wipe out skillet.
        </li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in skillet over medium. Add shallot and garlic; cook, stirring constantly,
            until fragrant and garlic just starts to brown, about 1 minute. Add wine, and cook, stirring occasionally,
            until almost evaporated, about 1 minute. Add broth and lemon slices, and bring to a boil over medium; cook,
            stirring occasionally, until mixture is reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk in capers. Reduce heat to
            low, and whisk in remaining 5 tablespoons butter, 1 to 2 pieces at a time, until melted and sauce is creamy,
            about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer cutlets to plates, and spoon sauce evenly over top. Sprinkle evenly with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
