    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>
            Whisk together brown sugar, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, white pepper, and 1/2 cup of the water until combined;
            set aside. Thinly slice scallions, and separate white and light green parts from dark green parts; set
            aside.
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Sprinkle both sides of chicken evenly with
            salt and black pepper. Add chicken to skillet, rounded sides down, and cook until golden brown, about 10
            minutes. Flip chicken, and continue to cook until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion registers 165
            degrees F (73 degrees C), about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large plate, and cover loosely with aluminum foil
            to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Add ginger, garlic, and reserved white and light green scallion parts to drippings in skillet, and cook over
            medium-high, stirring often, until garlic and ginger are fragrant and lightly toasted, and scallions are
            starting to fall apart, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk together cornstarch and remaining 1 tablespoon water until smooth. Add cornstarch mixture and soy
            sauce mixture to skillet. Bring to a boil over medium-high. Reduce heat to low to maintain a simmer, and
            cook, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 1 minute. Remove from
            heat.
        </li>
        <li>Return chicken and any residual juices to skillet, tossing to coat evenly in soy sauce mixture. Garnish with
            sesame seeds and dark green scallion parts. Serve over rice. </li>
    </ol>
